# Prometheus is not designed to be horizontally scalable behind a single load
# balancer. This configuration will increase the replicas in the Prometheus
# StatefulSet, and assign a different Service to each Pod. In this way,
# applications with high availability requirements may handle retrying for
# missing data on the other Service(s). The StatefulSet will manage the Pods
# such that only one is replaced at a time.
