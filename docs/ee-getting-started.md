## Prerequisites

The Astronomer platform is Kubernetes agnostic. This means that any Kubernetes
management solution should support the installation, and management of the
Astronomer platform. To ensure the platform can be effectively installed and
managed, ensure your team can meet the following requirements.

* A Kubernetes cluster managed by [one of these solutions]( https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/pick-right-solution/)
* Admin level access to the Kubernetes cluster
* Ability to provision a Tiller service account for use with Helm
* A base domain
* A CA signed wildcard for your base domain. This cannot be a self-signed certificate
* A postgres database
* A wildcard DNS A record
