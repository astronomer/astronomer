**Checklist**

- [ ]  Chart.yaml version and appVersion updated (matching)
- [ ]  For each modified subchart, charts/subchart/Chart.yaml version and appVersion updated (appVersion should match the corresponding image tag - in the case of the Astronomer subchart it should match the houston image version)
