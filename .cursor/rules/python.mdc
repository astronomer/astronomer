- All python code should have type hints.
- All python functions should have docstrings that explain what the function does.
- Python code should try to use the stdlib for solving problems.
- Any jmespath code should be refactored to not use jmespath.
- All date operations should be TZ aware, and should output iso8601 compatible utc unless specified otherwise.
- Use match ... case instead of if ... elif.
- Be specific about which exceptions are being caught.
- Use pathlib for all filesystem operations.
- Use requests for all http operations, and always specify an http request timeout.
- Here is an example of a good function definition:
    ```python
    def calculate_area(radius: float) -> float:
        """
        Calculate the area of a circle given the radius.

        Parameters:
        radius (float): The radius of the circle.

        Returns:
        float: The area of the circle.
        """
        import math
        return math.pi * radius ** 2
    ```
