  # TODO: We need tests here for the syntax changes in ingress between 1.18 and 1.19

  # This test passes with latest quintush but fails with our old fork of helm-unittest.
  # https://github.com/astronomer/issues/issues/2701
  # Manual testing shows that it should pass:
  #   helm template . --set global.baseDomain=example.com --kube-version=1.19.0 --show-only charts/astronomer/templates/ingress.yaml
  #
  # - it: "Should use ingress networking.k8s.io/v1 with k8s >= 1.19"
  #   set:
  #     global.baseDomain: example.com
  #   capabilities:
  #     majorVersion: 1
  #     minorVersion: 19
  #   asserts:
  #     - equal:
  #         path: apiVersion
  #         value: networking.k8s.io/v1

  # This passes now, but we don't know when it will begin to fail and the prior will begin to pass, so we preemptively comment it out
  # - it: "Should use ingress networking.k8s.io/v1beta1 with k8s < 1.19"
  #   set:
